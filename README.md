# Reverse-Image-Search-Using-DL
The `Reverse Image Search` system allows users to upload an image and find visually similar images from a pre-define dataset using deep learning. This technique relies on `feature extraction` using a pre-trained `ResNet50` model (without the top classification layers), converting images into high-dimensional `feature embeddings`.)
